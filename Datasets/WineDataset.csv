"Bread & Butter 'Winemaker's Selection' Chardonnay 2020/21, California","This really does what it says on the tin. It’s a lush Chardonnay which tastes of – you guessed it – bread and butter. The winemaking team combine grapes from two very different regions to create something full but fresh. Monterey is known for its big Chardonnays, but Carneros is far cooler, so flavours are more understated. And you'll taste the benefits in this bold and buttery wine. It’s silky smooth with fresh notes of citrus and vanilla. It’s incredibly versatile, but we like it best with creamy tarragon chicken or soft, creamy cheese.",£15.99 per bottle,75CL,Chardonnay,,Natural Cork,USA,10.1,"Vanilla, Almond, Coconut, Green Apple, Peach, Pineapple, Stone Fruit",per bottle,White,ABV 13.50%,California,Rich & Toasty,2021,Napa Valley

It was even formerly named the ‘Best Sauvignon Blanc in the World’ – and they have the name recognition to prove it. It’s really no surprise then that their Sauvignon is textbook Marlborough. Big.

Louis Latour Mâcon-Lugny 2021/22,"We’ve sold this wine for thirty years – and for that whole time it’s been a bestseller. Why’s it so popular? White Burgundy is a go-to for Chardonnay drinkers, and the Mâconnais in particular offers great value. Unlike the northern Côtes, the southern part of Burgundy doesn’t have a formalised vineyard hierarchy system. So the wines tend to be a bit more wallet-friendly. Not to mention, Lugny is one of the best regarded villages in the Mâcon, and Latour one of the most famous houses. Honeyed. Peachy. Crisp. A dream with salty finger foods or a classic Sunday roast chicken.

That’s exactly what you’ll get with this wine, a textbook Californian Pinot Noir from the same winery which brought you the sell-out Bread & Butter Chardonnay. Their vineyards are ideally located for classic varieties like Pinot. It’s sun-drenched, but cooled by the daily morning mists which roll in off the Pacific. It’s exactly the sort of position that pernickety Pinot thrives in. This deliciously silky wine proves our point. It’s all about red fruit. Cherries. Raspberries. Cranberries. It’s seriously juicy and seriously delicious, with a nice fullness which is classic California. Oak ageing gives it a touch of cedary spice, and woody herb notes. Perfect with roast mushrooms.",£15.99 per bottle,75CL,Pinot Noir,,Natural Cork,USA,10.1,"Smoke, Black Cherry, Cedar, Raspberry, Red Fruit",per bottle,Red,ABV 13.50%,California,Smooth & Mellow,2021,Napa Valley
Louis Roederer 'Cristal' Champagne 2015,"Cristal is Louis Roederer’s flagship wine. It was first made in 1876, when Tsar Alexander II asked the house to reserve their best cuvee for him every year. But he had another request. Fearful of an assassination attempt, he asked that it be produced in a clear bottle with no indent, called a ‘punt’, in the bottom. And an icon was born. It’s made from seven Grand Crus and only in the best years, when low-yielding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vines produce perfectly ripe grapes. Rich and velvety, it has intense and complex notes of ripe citrus, golden apple and almond pastry with an incredibly long and elegant finish.",£300.00 per bottle,75CL,Chardonnay,,Natural Cork,France,9,,per bottle,White,ABV 12.00%,,,2015,

And now, with Le Black Création, winemaker Hervé Dantan has redefined it. Each Création is unique, made with the best grapes from over 100 crus and reserve wines dating back over a decade. And each blend carries its own number – in reference to the number of harvests that have taken place since Maison Lanson was founded in 1760. This, the 257th blend, predominantly uses wine from the 2017 vintage, which produced Chardonnay with marked freshness, intensely fruity Pinot Noir, and notably supple Pinot Meunier.

They're the hobbies of Michel Parisot - how he spends his downtime from making sublime Champagnes. It's a fitting portrait of a winemaker whose approach to traditional fizz is decidedly unconventional. Michel is all about maximum flavour. Pinot Noir grapes are picked late in the harvest for as much aromatic flavour as possible. Michel then uses only the first press of the grapes, guaranteeing freshness. The wine is then aged for a minimum of four years – far longer than the required 30 months. The result is a rosé Champagne which punches well above its price point.

It’s fantastically plush and full of flavour – all thanks to the ‘appassimento’ style of winemaking.

It concentrates all the sugars and flavours in the grapes, making the texture seriously lush and velvety. With this intensity you won’t believe the price.

"Pasqua 'PassioneSentimento' Passimento Bianco 2021, Veneto","Think ‘appassimento’, you'll most likely think Amarone – or other really plush reds. It’s a method of making wine with a portion of dried grapes, concentrating all the flavours and giving it a real richness of texture. But this wine is a little different. For a start, it’s white – and every single part of its production is designed to make it richer and more intensely flavoured. The grapes are left to dry in special racks, concentrating the sugars and aromas. After it’s pressed the wine is left on its skins to make the texture rounded and the flavours bolder. Finally, a portion is aged in oak for added creaminess. No wonder it’s a beast of a wine. Bold. Fruity. Plush. There’s a lovely balance of fresh citrus flavours and apricoty, peachy richness.

"The King's Favour Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","Brent Marris is winemaking royalty. And it turns out, he may be descended from actual royalty too. His ancestor, William de Marisco was rumoured to be the illegitimate son of Henry I – not that that guaranteed the family good relations with royalty. The de Mariscos spent much of the 12th and 13th centuries living a life of piracy on the Isle of Lundy. Brent created the King Series to celebrate his family’s history, and their tempestuous relationship with the monarchy.

Specifically: crisp, citrussy, refreshing Chardonnay. Chablis is a lot further north than the rest of Burgundy so has a cooler climate.

What they discovered were grapes of such incredible quality they warranted extra special care and attention. They handpicked and carefully sorted the grapes, then slowly aged the wine in oak barrels. The resulting wine is richly fruity with a twist of charred BBQ spice – it’s like Porta 6 but smoother, richer and even more delicious.

"Silver Ghost Sauvignon Blanc 2022/23, Central Valley","Just because it’s inexpensive, doesn’t mean it’s not great quality. This wine is actually made for us by one of the most prestigious winemaking families in Chile, the Arestis. They know how to get the very best peachy, citrussy flavours out of their grapes, while still keeping prices wallet-friendly. The Central Valley, where this wine is from, is cool but has loads of sunshine – so this is more like a ripe white Bordeaux than a full, tropically fruity Kiwi Sauvignon. The fact is, Chilean wines are just incredible value – a wine of this quality from another country could cost far more. In our book, that makes it the ideal party wine. It’s got a real citrussy zing and great tropical flavours. It’s incredibly refreshing, so your guests will be happy to drink it alone, or with finger foods.

Originally from Latvia, Russian Jack was one of these gentlemen of the road.  He'd appear on farms at harvest time to pick fruit, well into his old age. As a result, he became a bit of a legend. There's even a statue in his memory. And this wine lives up to his name. It's made with grapes from certified sustainable vineyards, and there’s no compromise on quality. Every vintage has only one bottling, with the wine left on its spent yeast cells (or ‘lees’) to concentrate the flavours and add texture.

In fact, it’s the only grape that’s grown in the whole region – so Montagny-based Cave de Buxy really know their Chardonnay inside-out. Montagny’s limestone soils mean the wines are fresh, with a fuller body than other Chalonnaise wines. The fruit flavours are really pronounced – a factor amped up by the fact that it’s ‘Vielles Vignes’. It’s made using grapes from thirty-year-old vines. Because they’re old, they only yield small amounts of grapes – so all the flavour is exceptionally concentrated. Think ripe apple, citrus and white blossom.

"Definition Malbec 2021/22, Mendoza","Argentine Malbec is so popular, few people realise the grape is actually native to France. Mendoza, Argentina’s Malbec-heartland, is the place to look for the style of lush, fruity Malbec which put Argentina on the map. So, when we wanted to add a Malbec to our Definition range, Mendoza was the only place to look. Specifically, the Uco Valley – a sub-region where high-altitude vineyards make the very best Malbec. Working with a top producer, we sourced parcels of super-ripe fruit. The result? This plush, silky red which is all about the plummy, cherry fruit flavours. We only used a very small amount of oak to add a bit of structure, but not overpower the vibrant fruitiness. It’s a really classic style – so it’s perfect with a good steak or other barbecued meats.

"Jackson Estate 'Stich' Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","This is named after Jackson Estate’s founder, John ‘Stich’ Stichbury, whose family have deep roots in Marlborough. But despite their long history, Jackson Estate have always preferred to keep production low key. They’re all about sustainably made wines, made with minimal winemaking intervention. This is released six months later than other Kiwi Sauvignons. That’s because it spends extra time ageing on the lees – giving a richness and roundness to the texture. This practice complements the restrained flavours, making for a more French, old-school style Sauvignon rather than the typical Marlborough tropical fruit-bomb.

You might think that the Rioja region is too hot to nurture a grape that thrives by the sea, but Valles de Sadacia is famed for its dry white wines. And this is a stellar example.

In French wine, all the focus is given to AOCs – controlled areas or appellations, where the type, style and quality of wine is rigorously controlled.

It was then that winemaker Kevin Judd registered the name Greywacke – just in case he ever needed it in the future. It was 16 years before he would. By then, Kevin had almost single-handedly put Marlborough on the map. Greywacke is his passion-project, his opportunity to make Sauvignon that's different to the typical herbaceous, tropical Marlborough style. He describes this as tasting like a sponge cake with lemon icing. It’s deliciously peachy, with flavours of melon and blackcurrant.

"Definition Chenin Blanc 2021/22, South Africa","Chenin is a bit of a South African speciality – and nobody does it better than DeMorgenzon.

Made at high altitude, it’s like mountain air – fresh and pure. These vineyards are the first place the sun hits on the old road between Stellenbosch and Cape Town. All that sun ripens the grapes to absolute perfection, making the wine incredibly aromatic. Think mandarins and nectarines – a fruit salad of a wine, with aging on the lees giving it a lovely rich, honeyed texture. Heady and delicious. Try it with scallops or onion tart.

"Santa Rita 'Medalla Real' Carménère 2019/21, Colchagua Valley","Carménère may be Chile’s flagship red grape. But did you know that its history stretches back to Bordeaux? When the tiny phylloxera bugs ravaged Europe in the nineteenth century, Bordeaux’s Carménère vines were a casualty. It had been a key component of some of the greatest claret at the time – but the vine was only saved by cuttings which had been taken to Chile.  So it’s no wonder that Santa Rita use Carménère to make this fantastically structured Gran Reserva, which is styled like a classic Bordeaux.

Waimea is on the edge of the Tasman Sea – a place regularly credited with being New Zealand’s sunniest spot. It’s the perfect place to grow Pinot Gris. Sheltered. Coastal. Sunny. The winemaker use specially selected yeasts which draw out the aromatics of the grape. They play it up by ageing the wine on its lees – spent yeast particles – to give more texture and flavour. Think lemon curd, pear drops, lavender and white peaches. It’s got a lovely lush, creamy, silky texture with hints of exotic spice. You’ll find it hard not to reach for a second glass.

Pavillon La Tourelle Bordeaux Supérieur 2019,"If you’re a fan of classic French reds that combine great quality with incredible value, look to wines labelled ‘Bordeaux Supérieur’. A step up from your average bottle, these delicious blends are made from vines with lower yields of grapes. Lower yields mean more concentrated flavours – and once you add a minimum of 12 months of oak ageing, you’re in for a flavourful, complex wine that’s a steal for the quality.

"Carpe Diem Feteasca Alba 2021/22, Moldova","No country better demonstrates the hidden treasures of Eastern Europe than Moldova. Many drinkers might regard it as a relatively new winemaking country; however, wines have been produced here for over five thousand years. Soviet times saw a drop off in quality and reputation, but producers such as Carpe Diem continue to set new trends for the industry. For four generations, the Lucas family have dedicated their lives to crafting expressive wines that reflect their unique terroir and local wine making traditions. However, the last century presented significant obstacles. In 1949, under the Soviet Union regime, the Lucas’ vineyards were nationalised and the whole of their family were deported to a Siberian labour camp. After several years, part of the family managed to return to the winery. And today, almost sixty years on, the Carpe Diem estate is thriving. While the Soviet threat has returned – with the winery pausing operations to aid their Ukrainian neighbours – their wines continue to go from strength to strength. Crafted from an indigenous variety, Feteasca Alba, this dry white has crisp notes of jasmine, white peach and newly cut grass.

It’s the level of Rioja which experiences the most oak ageing – giving it the most structure and ageing potential.

Such care and attention usually adds up to a big price tag, but this is a real steal. The lengthy ageing process makes for a flavoursome wine with both fresh and dried-fruit flavours.

It’s made with grapes from vineyards at seriously high altitude – over 3500 feet above sea level. It means the flavours become concentrated in the intense sun, but the nightly temperature drop keeps it fresh and silky.

It’s made using dried grapes. That’s standard practice for sweet wines. as it reduces the water volume in the grapes, upping the percentage of sugar. But Amarone ferments the grapes to dryness, meaning it’s got a lot of alcohol, a lot of viscosity – and a lot of flavour. It makes for a seriously opulent wine. Plush.

Madame Clicquot's innovative thinking saw her invent winemaking techniques that are still used in Champagne today. So it's no wonder her influence earned her the title of 'La Grande Dame de la Champagne'. This Pinot Noir-dominant cuvée was created in 1972 to honour the 'Great Lady' – and to also celebrate the bicentenary of the house.

"Cape Mentelle Shiraz 2018, Margaret River","Cape Mentelle is one of Margaret River’s 'founding five' wineries.

"Meerlust Merlot 2017/18, Stellenbosch","Long recognised for producing premium wines, Meerlust Estate has a winemaking history dating back to 1756. They were pioneers of Bordeaux varietals in the Cape, producing Bordeaux-style blends with a unique South African flair. Meerlust means ‘pleasure of the sea’, as the vineyards are refreshed by ocean breezes and evening mists which roll in from the coast. This allows the grapes to ripen slowly, developing complex flavours but retaining freshness too. Produced from decades-old vines, this complex Merlot is aged for 18 months in oak before it’s released. Its intense flavour and structure means it can age for up to another decade or more – so it’s no surprise leading critic Tim Atkin awarded it 91 points.

Grato Grati ‘Vecchia Annata’ Rosso Toscana 1999,"Despite the label, you can consider this bottle to be a Chianti Rufina Reserva DOCG – Chianti’s most northerly subzone – and the area renowned for making the region’s most long lived wines. Sat in the foothills of the Apennine mountains, vines here benefit from warm sunny days followed by cool nights. The huge changes in temperature results in wines with intense aromas and plenty of fresh acidity – and it’s this acidity that gives them their lengthy ageing potential. Due to a change in production rules in the 1980s, the prestigious Grato family can’t label this bottling a Chianti Rufina. They keep back some of their best cuvées, ageing them for longer than the DOCG panel allows. It means they become what's known as a declassified wine, but don’t let that fool you into thinking this is anything less than a first-rate Tuscan red. Predominantly Sangiovese, the blend spent 30 months in oak barrels, followed by further ageing in tank and bottle before release.

This is named 'Grande Réserve' for good reason – once it's aged in oak for ten months, it's not released until it's spent a further year in the bottle. As a result, it's truly indulgent.

"Vouvray Sec 'Expresion de Silex' 2020/21, Loire","Although Denis Meunier is only in his late 20s, his small domain is one of the most old-school in Vouvray. In 2012, he took over his father's 13 hectares of Chenin Blanc (with vines up to 65 years old) and has never looked back. This expression is taken from his younger vines (still an average of 25 years old) on chalk soils and is crafted without any oak.

"Waimea Estates Pinot Noir Rosé 2021, Nelson","Waimea’s vineyards are less than 1km from the Tasman sea on the sundrenched Waimea Plains of Nelson. It’s one of New Zealand’s lesser-known wine regions and widely credited as New Zealand’s sunniest spot with an average of over 2400 hours of sunshine annually. This means perfectly-ripe grapes with plenty of freshness. 100% sustainably-farmed Pinot Noir grapes are gently pressed to release the premium free-run juice and spend only a short while on their skins. The result? A delicate platinum pink colour and vibrant fruit flavours. Expect ripe flavours of raspberry, strawberries, cherry and notes of jasmine. Perfect as an apéritif, with nibbles and, of course, strawberries and cream.",£13.99 per bottle,75CL,Pinot Noir,,Screwcap,New Zealand,9.8,"Floral, Raspberry, Red Cherry, Strawberry",per bottle,Rosé,ABV 13.00%,Nelson,Delicate & Dry,2021,
